								Hi! I'm Laura Uronen - pronounced as when speaking Spanish. I'm a scattered immigrant, not unlike the many particle interactions I got to study during my undergraduate course. My family background is from Finland and Karelia, to which I am and always will be reconnecting. I've lived my entire life abroad, moving between France, Spain, Scotland, and now Hong Kong, and each of these have leave their unique trace on my life.
							</p>
							<p>
								Currently, I am a fresh and green PhD student in Gravitational Wave physics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In my free time, I'm avidly indoorsy and you can find me reading, playing TTRPGs and video games, or learning languages. 
							</p>

								<b><u>Education</u></b>
								<br> Doctor of Philosophy in Physics <br><i>The Chinese University of Hong Kong (2023-Present)</i><br>
								<br> Astrophysics MPhys (Hons), 1st Class <br><i>University of St Andrews (2018-2023)</i>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b><u>Research Interests</u></b>
								<br> Still very early in my career, I have many research interests though most of them lie in the realm of gravitational wave physics. My PhD aims to look at the gravitational lensing of these waves and the information we can obtain from this effect. 
								My skills lie mainly in data analysis, and I am focusing my efforts on learning Bayesian analysis. Other aspects of interest to me are compact objects, as well as pulsars and PTAs.

								<br>Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme at CUHK, 2023-2027.

								<b>Partial eclipse of the heart for HD 181793 </b><br><i>Supervisor: Prof. Andrew C. Cameron</i><br>My Masters' dissertation project sought to establish the system parameters of the new heartbeat binary HD 181793. The project used radial velocity and transit fitting in conjunction with spectral separation to determine the orbital and stellar characteristics, followed by heartbeat modelling to identify the heartbeat pattern.

								<b>Danse macabre: direct detection of the sub-stellar donor in PHL 1445 </b><br><i>Supervisor: Dr. Juan V. Hernandez Santisteban</i><br>Summer research project that consisted of locating the sub-stellar companion in PHL 1445 using Doppler tomography.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								<b>General Skills</b><br>I have experience in a variety of computation methods and languages, having used FORTRAN to build N-body gravitational systems as well as conducting a variety of Monte Carlo Radiation Transfer simulations. I also have extensive experience in using Python for data analysis, and I have had a brief introduction to supervised machine learning in Python.

								As a queer immigrant in Astrophysics, working towards an inclusive and welcoming Physics community is a driving factor in the roles I've taken on. My background and experiences have meant I've seen both the work that remains to be done, but also the distance we've already come. For science to be meaningful it also needs compassion, and it is the reason I want to be involved in interacting on a deeper level within the community.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								<b><u>Roles</u></b>
								<br> <i>President, University of St Andrews Physics Society (2022-2023)</i> - I have occupied a variety of roles in the Physics Society between 2019 and my graduation, and for my final year I was elected to be the President of the Physics Society. Organising and chairing our biweekly meetings as well as coordinating the events that our Society ran across the year were the main elements of my position. We ran a variety of events, academic, professional and social in nature, as well as the St Andrews Interdisciplinary Science Conference aimed at introducing interdisciplinary research in science at the University to students.
							</p>
							<p>
								<i>Class Representative (2021-2022)</i> - As class representative, my position involved gathering student feedback in modules taken across the cohort, and attending regular Student-Staff Council meetings to communicate any issues and concerns with staff and coordinate with staff to find solutions where possible.
							</p>
							<p>
								<i>Student Ambassador (2019-2023)</i> - Student ambassadors assist with open days, and I regularly participated in open days both to offer holders as well as prospective students. On many occasions, this involved either presenting science demonstrations, or answering panel questions and hosting small-group discussions to speak on my experience at the University.

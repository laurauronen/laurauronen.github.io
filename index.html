								Speak, friend, and enter!

							<p>
								I'm Laura Uronen - for the pronunciation, the Spanish way is a safe bet. I'm a Karelian-Finnish PhD student in gravitational wave physics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and I've been a LIGO member since 2023.
								While my research primarily focuses on gravitational-wave data analysis and the search for gravitational-wave lensing, I also want to bridge the gaps in multi-messenger physics.
								One of my main research projects is the localization of black hole mergers through the combination of lensed gravitational waves and their lensed electromagnetic galactic hosts.
								Black holes are dark, and therein lies the obvious challenge in finding them. Lensing, and combining gravitational wave information with electromagnetic data, can help us break that wall into new physics. 
								My motivation is two-fold: first of all, gravitational waves as a measure of the music of the Universe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWqhUANNFXw&ab_channel=GeorgiaTech" target="_blank">(you can listen to it!)</a>, 
								and enabling new opportunities for multi-messenger science. Binary neutron stars have had it a little too good.
								
							</p>
							<p>
								For my background, I've been an immigrant my whole life and lived abroad the whole time, moving between France, Spain, Scotland where I did my undergraduate degree, and now Hong Kong, making me rather like a photon (very scattered). 
								In my free time, I'm avidly indoorsy and you can find me playing piano, TTRPGs and video games, or learning languages.

								<b><u>Research Interests</u></b>
								<br>We start several million of years ago, with a pair of black holes. 
								Take the Universe as a big, flat sheet, and put two black holes in it. 
								These black holes make a dent in the sheet: matter tells spacetime how to curve.
								Now, imagine these two black holes orbiting each other -- otherwise, they would just fall right into each other's dents. 
								As they orbit, the black holes have to work to move the spacetime around them, so they lose energy from their orbit -- this energy is emitted as gravitational waves, which emit from the pair like ripples across a calm lake.
								Everything that accelerates in the Universe will emit these waves, but they are so minute that most will never be detected.
								The loss of energy from the orbit means that these two black holes will orbit each other closer and closer, soon entering what will become the final spins of a death waltz. 
								These gravitational waves are emitted at even greater energies, at higher frequencies, until the black holes finally crash into each other and merge into a new, larger black hole.
								A compact binary merger has just happened.
								And now flash forward millions of (light) years away, in both time and distance, and we zoom back to Earth. Einstein's theory of General Relativity is proven right, and we successfully measured these gravitational waves for the first time in 2015.
								This threw all of gravitational-wave physics into a new and exciting era: that of empirical observations.

								<br>Gravitational lensing is a well-established field of research over on the side of electromagnetic observations, but it's an emerging one when it comes to gravitational waves.
								By necessity, since the first gravitational-wave detection was only a handful of years ago. 
								But both gravitational waves and lensing are consequences of Einstein's General Relativity: so if light is lensed, then it's only natural that gravitational waves are also lensed.

								<br>

								<br> I mainly achieve this through Bayesian inference, which is roughly what I spend 90% of my research doing.

								<b>Partial eclipse of the heart for HD 181793 </b><br><i>Supervisor: Prof. Andrew C. Cameron</i><br>(Submitted for review) My Masters' dissertation project sought to establish the system parameters of the new heartbeat binary HD 181793. The project used radial velocity and transit fitting in conjunction with spectral separation to determine the orbital and stellar characteristics, followed by heartbeat modelling to identify the heartbeat pattern.

								As an immigrant woman in Astrophysics, working towards an inclusive and welcoming Physics community is a driving factor in the roles I've taken on. My background and experiences have meant I've seen both the work that remains to be done, but also the distance we've already come. For science to be meaningful it also needs compassion, and it is the reason I want to be involved in interacting on a deeper level within the community.

								<b><u>Roles</u></b>
								<br> <i>President, University of St Andrews Physics Society (2022-2023)</i> - I have occupied a variety of roles in the Physics Society between 2019 and my graduation, and for my final year I was elected to be the President of the Physics Society. Organising and chairing our biweekly meetings as well as coordinating the events that our Society ran across the year were the main elements of my position. We ran a variety of events, academic, professional and social in nature, as well as the St Andrews Interdisciplinary Science Conference aimed at introducing interdisciplinary research in science at the University to students.
							</p>
							<p>
								<i>Class Representative (2021-2022)</i> - As class representative, my position involved gathering student feedback in modules taken across the cohort, and attending regular Student-Staff Council meetings to communicate any issues and concerns with staff and coordinate with staff to find solutions where possible.
